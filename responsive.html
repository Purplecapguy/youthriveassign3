                <p>Sporting CP manager Amorim has stood out as the favourite to succeed Jurgen Klopp this summer, following Xabi Alonso’s decision to stay at Bayer Leverkusen. There has now been a significant twist, however, with the reliable David Ornstein, from the Athletic, claiming that West Ham have held talks and that a move to Liverpool is now deemed “unlikely.” At this point, who on earth is the Reds’ next manager going to be? The odds tell us Feyenoord’s Arne Slot is now the favourite! Better start digging into him.</p>
